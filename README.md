# Marvel-comics-issues
I am working on a project that allows me to access Marvel's API and explore comic book issues. I'm a beginner, but with the help of ChatGPT, I have made significant progress. I'm trying to develop a program that searches for a Marvel character and downloads any issues they have been in, then stores them in an Excel spreadsheet. I have almost completed it. Currently, I can only download 20 issues, but I would like to obtain more information about the comics. So far, I can only download one comic book cover. Is anyone interested in examining my code and seeing if there's anything that can assist me?

Go to https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started to get your api with Marvel. Then in the marvel_search.py update your PUBLIC_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY.
